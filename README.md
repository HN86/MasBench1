abstract = {Multi-agent crowd simulation is generally used to construct an environment suitable for reality by parameter estimation. This estimation is to modify a model defined by human movements and behaviors to fit real-world data by means of statistics or optimization [2, 11]. In the field of traffic engineering, for example, parameter estimation is used to modify speed models and collision models of pedestrians and vehicles [10, 13]. For different simulation settings, it is not easy to obtain original data of each real-world environment. Few existing estimation methods have been fairly evaluated. Therefore, there is a need for a benchmark to discuss the applicability of certain estimation methods to other use cases.},
